PURE LOGICS

I HAVE architectural plan to implement the Dual-Mode System (Grid vs. Cinematic).

🔍 Deep Zoom & Pan: In Zen Mode, you can now use your Mouse Wheel to zoom in/out and Click-Drag to pan around. This is critical for checking focus (eyes, sharpness).

⚡ High-Res Logic: The app now smartly switches between "Fast Thumbnail" (Grid) and "Full Resolution" (Zen) so zooming is crisp, not pixelated.

🎮 Smart Navigation: Added Home, End, PageUp, PageDown support to jump through your gallery instantly.

_____________________________________________________________
✅ Import Repair: The Dashboard is now correctly wired.

⭐ Star Ratings (1-5): Press keys 1 through 5 to rate an image. The rating is saved to the database.

📏 Dynamic Grid Scaling: Press Ctrl + to zoom in (fewer columns) or Ctrl - to zoom out (more columns) on the Grid.

🌟 Visual Indicators: Grid cards now show gold stars if rated.

🗑️ Trash Rejects: A new button in the Export Studio to Move Rejects to a _TRASH folder (Safe Deletion).

⚡ "Delete" Key Mapping: The Del key now works as an alias for X (Reject), matching standard OS behavior.

__
🎨 Color Labels (Keys 6-9): You can now tag photos with Red, Yellow, Green, Blue labels.

🗂️ Range Selection (Shift+Click): Hold Shift to select a whole group of photos in the Grid.

⚡ Bulk Actions: If you have 50 photos selected, pressing X or 5 applies the rating to ALL of them instantly.

🔃 Sorting Engine: New dropdown to sort by Filename, Rating, or Status.

⌨️ Pro Hotkeys: Added Industry Standards: G (Grid), E (Zen/Loupe), L (Lights Out / Hide UI).

📂 Context Menu: Right-click any photo to "Reveal in Explorer" or Copy Path.

⏭️ Auto-Advance Toggle: A new switch in the toolbar to turn off "Jump to next after tag" if you prefer staying put.

🔦 "Lights Out" Mode: Press L to dim the interface and focus only on the photo.

⭐ Advanced Filtering: You can now filter specifically by Star Rating (e.g., ">= 3 Stars").

🎞️ Filmstrip Sync: The bottom filmstrip in Zen Mode now auto-scrolls to keep the active photo centered

#,Feature / Logic,Status,Testing Status,Action to Test
1,Frozen 4x4 Grid,✅ Fixed,◽ Untested,Open folder; verify exactly 4 columns without side-scrolling.
2,Double-Tap to Zen,✅ Restored,◽ Untested,"Double-click any grid image to enter the ""Filmy Strip"" mode."
3,Interactive Filmstrip,✅ Restored,◽ Untested,"In Zen mode, verify thumbnails move Right-to-Left at the bottom."
4,Auto-Advance Toggle,✅ Fixed,◽ Untested,Rate an image; verify it ticks/unticks and jumps to next.
5,Path Integrity,✅ Patched,◽ Untested,"Confirm ""FileNotFound"" errors (e.g., Error 'C') are gone."

==============================
FREEZED
==============================
✅ Locks Grid: If you uncheck "Dynamic Zoom" in settings, the Ctrl +/- keys are disabled, locking your layout as requested._



_____________________________________________________________
__
Executive Dashboard: A persistent landing page that eliminates the need to re-import folders.

Mathematical Grid Alignment: A perfectly symmetrical layout that adapts to any column count (3, 5, 8, etc.).

Luxury Visual Feedback: Gold high-contrast borders, rounded corners, and a "Cinematic" dark-mode aesthetic.

Precision Zoom Viewer: A high-performance graphics engine for fluid mouse-wheel zooming and click-drag panning.

Filmstrip Navigation: A continuous thumbnail strip for context while in high-detail Zen mode.

Dynamic Settings Interface: A dedicated panel to control advanced app behaviors and grid properties.
__
1. UI Features Discussed for Update
These were the conceptual requirements we aimed to integrate to transform the app into a "Billionaire's Tool":

Executive Dashboard: A landing page that remembers recent folders and shows project progress without re-importing.

Mathematical Grid Alignment: A perfectly symmetrical layout that adapts to different column counts (3, 5, 8, etc.) without "jagged" edges.

Luxury Visual Feedback: Gold high-contrast borders for selection, rounded corners, and a dark-mode "Cinematic" aesthetic.

Precision Zoom Viewer: A high-performance graphics engine for Zen mode that supports fluid mouse-wheel zooming and click-drag panning.

Filmstrip Navigation: A continuous strip of thumbnails at the bottom of the Zen view for contextual navigation.

Dynamic Settings Interface: A dedicated preferences window to toggle advanced behaviors like Dynamic Grid vs. Locked 5x5.

2. Features Currently Updated & Live
The current code you possess includes the following 18 core logics:

✅ Intelligent Dashboard: Successfully lists recent projects with "One-Click Resume" capability.

✅ 1-5 Star Rating: Numeric keys 1 through 5 apply star ratings instantly to the database.

✅ 6-9 Color Labels: Keys 6 through 9 apply Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue background tints.

✅ Shift+Click Multi-Select: Allows selecting massive ranges of photos for bulk tagging.

✅ Bulk Action Processing: Applying a rating or label while multiple photos are selected updates all of them at once.

✅ Mathematical Grid Fix: Uses setColumnStretch to ensure columns are identical in width regardless of window size.

✅ Auto-Next Logic: Automatically jumps to the next image after a rating is applied (optional toggle).

✅ Industry Hotkeys: G for Grid, E for Zen (Loupe), and L for Lights Out mode.

✅ Lights Out Mode: A distraction-free overlay for critical image inspection.

✅ Trash Engine: A dedicated button in the Export Studio to move "Rejects" into a safe _TRASH subfolder.

✅ Advanced Filtering: Filter the view by status (Keep/Reject) or by "★ Rated" only.

✅ Sorting Engine: Dropdown to sort by Filename, Date Modified, or Rating.

✅ Context Menu: Right-click functionality to "Reveal in Explorer."

✅ Database Persistence: All settings, ratings, and color tags are saved permanently in dsr_pro_data.db.

✅ Filmstrip Sync: The filmstrip highlights and scrolls to the active image in Zen mode.

✅ Dynamic Grid Zoom: Ctrl + + and Ctrl + - to change column counts on the fly.

✅ Double-Click Navigation: Double-click Grid to enter Zen; double-click Zen to return to Grid.

✅ High-Res Zoom Viewer: Zen mode now uses a QGraphicsView engine for smooth scaling.

3. Next Plan Logics (The "AI" Phase)
Now that the Manual Pro-Suite is complete, our next focus is the "Intelligence" layer:

Logic A: AI Grouping (Similarity): Automatically clustering photos taken in the same "burst" (e.g., 5 similar wedding poses) so you only see the best one.

Logic B: Face Focus Detection: Automatically zooming into the primary face in Zen mode to check if eyes are open or closed without manual zooming.

Logic C: Blur/Sharpness Scoring: An AI-calculated score that marks photos as "Soft" or "Sharp" to help you reject out-of-focus shots instantly.

Logic D: Duplicate Identification: Spotting exact or near-exact duplicates and suggesting which one to keep based on technical quality.

Logic E: Advanced Exporting: Options to export "Keeps" into subfolders based on their Star Rating or Color Label.
