Step,Feature,Industrial Benefit
1,The Logic Harmonizer,"Merges face_priority into ai_logic. If a VVIP is detected, the ""Reject"" becomes ""Pending""."
2,The Metadata Ticker,Logic for auto-tagging images with hashtags like #EyesClosed or #MotionBlur for the database.
3,The Intelligent Search,Logic to find specific people across 30k images using the embeddings we've saved.
4,"The ""Safety Net"" Undo","Logic to store ""Previous State"" in the database so bulk actions can be reverted."
5,The Memory Optimizer,"Logic to ""forget"" raw embeddings once the analysis is done to keep the DB size small."
